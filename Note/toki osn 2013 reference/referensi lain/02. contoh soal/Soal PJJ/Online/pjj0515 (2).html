<!-- problem statement -->
<div id="problem">
<p>
Deciphering the Mayan writing has proven to be a harder task than anticipated by the early 
investigations. After almost two hundred years, very little of it was actually understood.  It has been 
only in the last three decades that real advances have been made.   
</p>
<p>
Mayan writing is based on small drawings known as glyphs which represent sounds.  Mayan words 
are normally written as glyphs put together at various positions. 
</p>
<p>
One of several problems in deciphering Mayan writing arises in the order of reading. When placing 
several glyphs in order to form a word, Mayan writers sometimes decided the position based more 
on their own esthetic views than on any particular rule. This leads to the fact that, even though the 
sound for many glyphs is known, sometimes archaeologists are not sure how to pronounce a 
written word. 
</p>
<p>
The archaeologists are looking for a special word W. They know the glyphs for it, but they don't 
know all the possible ways of arranging them.  Since they knew you were coming to IOI'06, they 
have asked for your help. They will provide you with the g glyphs from W and a sequence S of all 
the glyphs (in the order they appear) in the carvings they are studying.  Help them by counting the 
number of possible appearances of the word W.
</p>
<p>
Write a program that, given the glyphs for W and the sequence S of glyphs in the carvings, counts 
the number of possible appearances of W in S; that is, every sequence of consecutive g glyphs in S 
that is a permutation of the glyphs in W.

<div id="inputformat"> 
<h2> FORMAT MASUKAN </h2>
<p>
LINE 1: Contains 2 space-separated integers that represent g and |S|. 
<br>
LINE 2: Contains g consecutive characters that represent the glyphs 
in W.  Valid characters are 'a'-'z' and 'A'-Z'; uppercase and 
lowercase characters are considered different. 
<br>
LINE 3: Contains |S| consecutive characters that represent the glyphs 
in the carvings. Valid characters are 'a'-z' and 'A'-Z'; 
uppercase and lowercase characters are considered different. 
<br>
1 &le; g &le; 3 000 , the number of glyphs in W

g &le; |S| &le; 3 000 000 , where |S| is the number of glyphs in the sequence S
